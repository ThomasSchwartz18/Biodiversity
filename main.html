          I will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of
          these<br />
          species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the
          types<br />
          of species that become endangered. During this project, I will
          analyze,<br />
          clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer
          them<br />
          in a meaningful way.<br />

          After I perform my analysis, I will share my findings about the

        <ul>
          <li>
            These NaN values represent animals that are not in any stage of the
            endangered process.

          <li>
            To clean this data I ran the following code:

            />
            <br />
            This allowed me to change the value of NaN to something more
            appropriate and easier to understand.
          </li>
          <li>
            To prevent an unreadable chart I extracted the
            <code>No Intervention</code> to plot

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          The column <code>conservation_status</code> has several possible
          values:
          <br />
          - <code>Speciesof Concern</code>: declining or appear to be in need of
          conservation <br />
          - <code>Threatened</code>: vulnerable to endangerment in the near
          future
          <br />
          - <code>Endangered</code>: seriously at risk of extinction <br />
          - <code>In Recovery</code>: formerly <code>Endangered</code>, but
          currently neither in danger of extinction throughout all or a
          significant portion of its range <br />
          In the exploration, a lot of <code>NaN</code> values were detected.
          These values were converted to <code>No Intervention</code>.

          The next question is if certain types of species are more likely to be
          <br />
          endangered? This can be answered by creating a new column called
          <br />
          <code>is_protected</code> in the species table and include any species
          that had a value other <br />

            With this table I can better analyse that 15% of birds are protected
            and 17% of Mammals are protected. Both of which are significantly
            higher probability of endagerment than other animals.

        <p>
          This section will run some chi-squared tests to see if different
          species have statistically significant differences in conservation
          status rates. In order to run a chi squared test, a contingency table
          will need to be created.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first test will be called `contingency1` and will need to be
          filled with the correct numbers for mammals and birds. The results
          from the chi-squared test returns many values, the second value which
          is 0.69 is the p-value. The standard p-value to test statistical
          significance is 0.05. For the value retrieved from this test, the
          value of 0.69 is much larger than 0.05. In the case of mammals and
          birds there doesn't seem to be any significant relationship between
          them i.e. the variables independent.

          The next pair, is going to test the difference between `Reptile` and

        <p>
          This time the p-value is 0.039 which is below the standard threshold
          of 0.05 which can be take that the difference between reptile and
          mammal is statistically significant. Mammals are shown to have a
          statistically significant higher rate of needed protection compared
          with Reptiles.

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          The next set of analysis will come from data from the conservationists
          as they have been recording sightings of different species at several
          national parks for the past 7 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first step is to look at the the common names from `species` to
          get an idea of the most prevalent animals in the dataset. The data
          will be need to be split up into individual names. FOllowed by
          cleaning the duplicated words in the data.

        <p>
          Now the data is ready to be able to count the number of occurrences of
          each word. From this analysis, it seems that `Bat` occurred 23 times
          while `Shrew` came up 18 times.

          The total number of bats observed in each park over the past 7 days
          are in the table below. Yellowstone National Park seems to have the
          largest with 8,362 observations and the Great Smoky Mountains National
          Park having the lowest with 2,411.

          Now let's see each park broken down by protected bats vs.
          non-protected bat sightings. It seems that every park except for the
          Great Smoky Mountains National Park has more sightings of protected
          bats than not. This could be considered a great sign for bats.

          Below is a plot from the output of the last data manipulation. From
          this chart one can see that Yellowstone and Bryce National Parks seem
          to be doing a great job with their bat populations since there are
          more sightings of protected bats compared to non-protected species.
          The Great Smoky Mountains National Park might need to beef up there
          efforts in conservation as they have seen more non-protected species.

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          The project was able to make several data visualizations and
          inferences about the various species in four of the National Parks
          that comprised this data set.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was also able to answer some of the questions first posed
          in the beginning:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u>What is the distribution of conservation status for species?</u>
            <p>
              The vast majority of species were not part of conservation.(5,633
              vs 191)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?</u>
            <p>
              Mammals and Birds had the highest percentage of being in
              protection.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>
              Are the differences between species and their conservation status
              significant?
            </u>
            <p>
              While mammals and Birds did not have significant difference in
              conservation percentage, mammals and reptiles exhibited a
              statistically significant difference.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>
              Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution
              amongst parks?
            </u>
            <p>
              the study found that bats occurred the most number of times and
              they were most likely to be found in Yellowstone National Park.

          This dataset only included observations from the last 7 days which
          prohibits analyze changes over time. It would be curious to see how
          the conservation status for various species changes over time. Another
          piece that is missing is the Area of each park, it can be assumed that
          Yellowstone National Park might be much larger than the other parks
          which would mean that it would exhibit more observations and greater
          biodiversity. Lastly, if precise locations were recorded, the spatial
          distribution of the species could also be observed and test if these
          observations are spatially clustered.
